# 2048clone
Clone of the 2048 famous game.

This is my first Unity project, it is my version of 2048 tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCoRWCtZhMdgXuw2vThniQ. With time, I will be adding more features to the game to learn more about Unity and C#.

To do:

* ~~Update High Score only when the game is over.~~
* ~~Keep playing after reaching 2048 tile.~~
* ~~Keep adding numbers after reach 2048 tile.~~
* Make a menu with different board sizes 2\*2 4\*4 8\*8 16\*16.
* ~~Choose custom numbers and custom top number.~~
* Generate number 4 tile only when there is another number 4 available.
* Improve game visualization:
  * Set right padding and margins.
  * Change play again button.
  * Add more colors after tile 128.
